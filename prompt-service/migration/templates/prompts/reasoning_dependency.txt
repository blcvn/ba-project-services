Analyze the following "Target Batch" of Functional Requirements and identify dependencies.
You can reference any FR from the "Full Reference List".
Specifically, identify "Requires" relationships where a Target FR logically depends on another FR (from the Reference List).

Target Batch (Analyze these):
{{TARGET_BATCH}}

Full Reference List (For context only):
{{FULL_CONTEXT}}

instructions:
1. Return a list of dependencies.
2. Type is always "REQUIRES".
3. Reason should be brief.
4. SourceID MUST be from the "Target Batch".
5. TargetID MUST be from the "Full Reference List".
6. The 'reason' field must be in **Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt)**.

Output JSON (List):
[
  {
    "source_id": "FR-005",
    "target_id": "FR-001",
    "type": "REQUIRES",
    "reason": "Must authenticate before accessing profile"
  }
]
Return ONLY valid JSON. Return empty list [] if no dependencies found in this batch.
